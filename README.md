# Image-classification-In-Pyspark-and-Elephas

Detection of diseases a plant may have based on the images of the leaves.

• The leaves on a plant are like a barometer. They can tell you what is happening to the plant.So given labeled images of plant leaves,we use Machine learning to detect if a plant is healthy or not.

• The dataset contains RGB images of leaves from different plants facing from different diseases. There are a total of 38 classes in this dataset. But for our task, we have used 33 classes which span over 9 plant species. The training set contains total of 58579 images, out of which 80 percent are used while training and 20 percent as validation set. The testing set contains total of 15231 images.
